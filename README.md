# Text mining - coffee blogs 

This is my Text Mining project for coffee blogs. The elements of work:
* Pre-procesing
* Wordcloud and Zipf's distribution
* Bigrams
* 3-grams
* Matrix sparsity changes
* Business insights

In the file coffee blogs.R you can find the code which I used in my analysis and in the coffee blogs-report you can read the description and some conclusions.
